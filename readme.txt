Host Twitter images from your blog and keep your traffic, rather than using a service like Twitpic and losing your viewers.

== Description ==

Keep your traffic in the family!  Host Twitter images on your own site.

Image posting on Twitter works by hosting the image somewhere (either on Twitter's image service, or another service like Twitpic, img.ly, etc.). The service hosts the image for us (and we send them our traffic).

Better to take advantage of that traffic, and host images on your own site.  This way, viewers come to your site, instead
of someone else's!

In Twitter Image Host 2, images are posted as normal posts, in a category you choose. You can then configure your WordPress installation to display posts in this category as you wish.

Twitter Image Host 2 can be used at the same time as the original Twitter Image Host plugin, so the prior system will still work after updating.

Provides a utility within WordPress admin for posting image content, as well as an API modelled on that of [img.ly](http://img.ly/pages/API),
compatible with TweetBot (for iOS) and any other Twitter clients that speak this protocol and offer configuration of
custom image hosting services.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the package, and upload `twitter-image-host-2` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the settings page and configure the plugin
4. Start submitting images - See the 'Posting Images' section for more

If you find Twitter Image Host useful, please consider buying some great [iOS software](http://atastypixel.com/products). Then
tell all your friends, family and pets.

== Posting Images ==

To start posting from your WordPress blog, select the "Twitter Images" menu item from the "Posts" administration section.
Select your image file enter a message, then hit Post, and the image will be uploaded and your message sent to Twitter.

To access this facility from an application, use the access point displayed on the Twitter Image Host options page.

The API is more-or-less the same as that of [TweetPic](http://twitpic.com/api.do), [img.ly](http://img.ly/pages/API), etc.

On iOS at least, the Twitter app no longer supports custom images, but TweetBot does.  You can configure a custom image host within Settings -
enter the API URL as listed on the options page.

== Changelog ==

= 2.0 =

 * Initial release of Version 2, which now stores posted images as actual posts, rather than pseudo-posts.
